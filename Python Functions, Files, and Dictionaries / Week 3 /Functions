# Write a function called change that takes any string, adds “Nice to meet you!” to the end of the argument given, and returns that new string.

#You will need to write two functions for this problem. The first function, divide that takes in any number and returns that same number divided by 2. The second function called sum should take any number, divide it by 2, and add 6. It should return this new number. You should call the divide function within the sum function.
